As part of the "getting to know each other" process, we'd like you to work on a small project
which is hopefully a bit of fun. This is a chance for you to show off your coding skills. Think of
the project as something that would be continued with a bigger team.
Project Description:
Build a Web application which displays a TO-DO’s list using
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com, /todos endpoint.
Requirements:
• List should contain max 10 task.
• App should will allow user to change task status to done.
• App should allow user to add new task (if there is a room for that).
• App should allow user to remove only done task.
• App code should be available on GitHub.
Environments:
• Build on ReactJS using Redux.
• Use redux-saga
Bonus:

• For component style use styled-components. (https://github.com/styled-
components/styled-components)
